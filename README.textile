h1. Cantango Demo

*Welcome to the Cantango Rails 3 Demo application!*

This demo app aims to demonstrate how to use "CanTango":https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango in a Rails 3 application. 

h2. Integrations

Integrations to be included are:

* "Devise":https://github.com/plataformatec/devise - Authentication
* "Troles"::https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango - Roles and Rolegroups
* "Active Admin":https://github.com/gregbell/active_admin - Admin UI
* "CanTango editor":https://github.com/stanislaw/cantango_editor - Web UI interface to manage permissions

h2. Engines

The following CanTango engines will be demonstrated, working together:

* Permissions
* Permits
* User AC

h2. Caching

The engines will be executed in the following cache configuration

* Permissions - Cache
* Permits - Cache and No Cache
* User AC - Cache

The _No Cache_ mode for Permits, will allow inclusion of permit rules that can NOT be cached due to dynamic conditional logic surrounding them. Here a very simplistic example to illustrate such a scenario:

<pre>
def permit_rules
  if the_sky_is_falling?
   can :reach, Sky
  else
   cannot :reach, Sky
  end
end
</pre>
